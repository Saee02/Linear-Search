# Linear-Search


Here is a C program that looks up a number in an array of integers. The array is initialized with 6 values: 2, 9, 10, 15, 3, and 10.
The user is prompted to enter a number to search for. This number is read into an integer variable search using the scanf function.
The program then uses a for loop to iterate through the array, checking each element to see if it matches the search value. 
If a match is found, the integer variable's counter is set to 1. After the for loop, the program checks the value of count. 
If count is 1, it means the search value was found in the array, and the program prints the message "That number exists."
If count is 0, it means the search value was not found in the array and the program displays the message "number does not exist".
